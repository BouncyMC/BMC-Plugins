# This file contains a set of predefined time controls.  These can be selected via the control
# panel by left- or right-clicking the "Time Control" sign.
#
# Edit this as you please, and run "/chess reload tc" when finished (or restart the server).
# Be sure to use valid YAML!  No tabs, and consistent indentation!
#
# The "label" must fit on three lines of the sign.  Use ";" for line breaks, no more than 15 
# characters per line.
#
# See http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/chesscraft/pages/time-controls for a description
# of the "spec" string.
