# Definition file for all available AIs.  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - if you want to define
# new aliases or change the parameters for existing AI's, see the AI.yml file.
#
# "class" is the AI implementation being used.  Must be one of "JChecsAI", "XBoardAI"
#  "JChecsAI" is the built-in AI engine
#  "XBoardAI" allows the use of external engines via the XBoard/WinBoard protocol
#
# "comment" is an optional comment which will be shown to players if they list the AI's
#
# "payout_multiplier" applies if Economy support is enabled.  Default is 1.0 - it could be
#   raised for tougher engines and lowered for weaker engines.
#
# All other parameters are engine-specific; see the website for full documentation:
#  http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/chesscraft/pages/ai
